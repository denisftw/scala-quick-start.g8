# Scala Quick Start

This is a `giter8` template that provides the skeleton of a basic Scala application

## Quick start

If you have `sbt` 0.13.13 or higher installed, you can initialize a new project from this template easily:

```sh
sbt new denisftw/scala-quick-start.g8
```

It will prompt you to type a project name and then initialize the project in a new directory.

## Versions used

The code uses Scala 2.13 along with sbt 1.3.
